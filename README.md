# Input/Output Definition

The goal was to command different paths or sequences previously defined (on [this repository](https://github.com/Canborda/robotics-lab1)) with the usage of __digital inputs__. In Robot Studio is possible to make simulation with "virtual" inputs & outputs, and in the physical laboratory we use industrial buttons to send a signal to the controller.

### I/O in RobotStudio

- Access to the I/O editor at `Controller` -> `Configuration` -> `I/O System`.

- A view with all I/O used in the controller will be open, but we can also define custom inputs & outputs. Right-click on `Signal` will raise a new window to create a custom signal.

- On the Instance Editor you will be able to select whether it is an input or an output and the type.

- With the `I/O simulator` you can set input signals and monitor output signals.

### I/O Module

The IRC5 controller has already configured an I/O module `3HAC025917-001/00 DSQC 652`, and we can access to digital inputs & outputs via a control panel like the shown in the image.

# RAPID Code

Within RAPID language is possible to define basic if/else sentences and loops, so the logic for this assignment was very straightforward. The algorithm consists on an infinite loop that waits until any digital input (`DI_01`, `DI_02`) has the value toggled on, and then execute the respective path procedure.

```
PROC main()
    Path_Start;
    RESET DO_01;
    WHILE TRUE DO
        IF DI_01 = 1 THEN
            Path_Start;
            SET DO_01;
            Path_B;
            Path_C;
            RESET DO_01;
        ELSEIF DI_02 = 1 THEN
            Path_Maintenance;
        ENDIF
    ENDWHILE
ENDPROC
```

# Demonstration

Due to time problems, the demonstration could not be completed, but in the previous video you can see that the simulation works perfectly.

# Conclusions

- The use of inputs and outputs in both an industrial and academic context is very importance, since it allows the degree of control of the manipulators to be increased, making it possible to manage routines as required or needed.
- The management of inputs and outputs together with RAPID programming, makes the use of manipulators more flexible, because compared to fixed routines, the only control you have is being able to pause, resume and make emergency stops. Combining routines with inputs, outputs and RAPID allows to make a better use of the information from the environment or that which comes from the operator himself.
- When making the transition from the simulation environment to the implementation in the manipulators, it must be taken into account that both the routines and WorkObjects are located in such a way that they will not reach a singularity, This will avoid the routines to stop during the path execution.
